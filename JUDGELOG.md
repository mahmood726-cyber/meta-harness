# Blind-judge log

Every deficiency a blind judge names is fixed in the **harness**, never patched on the page.
Record per topic: what the judge said · what changed in the machinery · whether the next topic
cleared it unaided.

## Topic 1 — colchicine for prevention of pericarditis recurrence
- **Registration SHA:** 34023da · **Published:** 40ebe40 · **Live:** /reviews/colchicine-recurrent-pericarditis/
- **Blind pair (neutral, opaque tokens):** ours `m979b0810`, comparator `m29f6dc16` (Imazio 2012 Heart, PMID 22442198, OA)
- **Fresh-clone reproduction:** byte-identical (empty git status after rebuild); census failures 0.
- **Result read by the judge (proof of reading):** ours k=3 RR 0.469 (0.266–0.827); comparator k=5 RR 0.40 (0.30–0.54). Correct.
- **Verdict:** Page 2 (ours) higher, **27 vs 14 / 35**.

### What the judge said (deficiencies)
1. **Both pages thin on secondary efficacy outcomes** (only primary recurrence). [scored (c)=2/2 both]
2. **Our harms are thin** — one GI estimate at k=1; discontinuation declared absent. [(d) ours 2 vs comparator 3]
3. (Implicit, and confirmed by self-audit) The comparator page names **zero trials** and declares Protocol/Screening/Reproducibility **absent** — but that is because **my `build_comparator_core` renders the comparator from its abstract only**, not because the published meta is that thin. **The win is therefore not clean.**

### What must change in the MACHINERY (queued, before the win counts)
- **F1 — faithful comparator rendering (highest priority).** The comparator page must represent the published meta's *actual* content: its included-trial list, its stated methods, its harms. Either extract them from the comparator's full text, or (cleaner) prefer comparators whose full text is machine-retrievable (PMC), so the benchmark is rendered fairly. Until then, blind wins are provisional.
- **F2 — carry secondary/harms outcomes wherever the sources report them** (e.g. symptom persistence at 72 h, hospitalization, which CORP/CORP-2/ICAP report), so "their outcomes not fewer" is met on breadth, not just the primary.
- **F3 — harms pooling** should include every trial that reports a harm count, and declare (not omit) the rest.

### Did the next topic clear it unaided?
- Pending (topic 2 not yet built). To be recorded here.
